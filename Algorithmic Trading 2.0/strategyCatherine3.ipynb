    "#   Q18 Machine Learning Rolling Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we predict whether the price will rise or fall by using supervised learning (Bayesian Ridge Regression). This template represents a starting point for developing a system which can take part to the **Q18 NASDAQ-100 Stock Long-Short contest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the **first part** we just perform a global training of the time series using all time series data. We disregard the sequential aspect of the data and use also future data to train past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the **second part** we use the built-in backtester and perform training and prediction on a rolling basis in order to avoid forward looking. Please note that we are using a **specialized** version of the Quantiacs backtester which dramatically speeds up the the backtesting process by retraining your model on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features for learning**: we will use several technical indicators trying to capture different features. You can have a look at [**Technical Indicators**](https://quantiacs.com/documentation/en/user_guide/technical_indicators.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your trading algorithm can open short and long positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each point in time your algorithm can trade all or a subset of the stocks which at that point of time are or were part of the NASDAQ-100 stock index. Note that the composition of this set changes in time, and Quantiacs provides you with an appropriate filter function for selecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Sharpe ratio of your system since January 1st, 2006, has to be larger than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your system cannot be a copy of the current examples. We run a correlation filter on the submissions and detect duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For simplicity we will use a single asset. It pays off to use more assets, ideally uncorrelated, and diversify your positions for a more solid Sharpe ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the rules can be found [here](https://quantiacs.com/contest).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need help?** Check the [**Documentation**](https://quantiacs.com/documentation/en/) and find solutions/report problems in the [**Forum**](https://quantiacs.com/community/categories) section.\n",
